"""
Define a function named alphabetical that accepts a list of words as its
only parameter and constructs/returns a list of strings with each
of the letters in each word sorted in alphabetical, not unicode, order.

For example, the call alphabetical(['apple', 'pumpkin', 'log', 'River',
'fox', 'pond']) should return the list ['aelpp', 'ikmnppu', 'glo',
'eiRrv', 'fox', 'dnop'].
