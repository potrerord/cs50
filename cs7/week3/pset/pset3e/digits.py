"""
If you take the number 2178, multiply it by four, and reverse the digits
â€” you will get 2178 again. This is the only four-digit number that has
this property. There is also a five- digit number that has the same
property. Write a program to find it! Note: you may not use any
functions we haven't yet covered, such as reversed(). As well, you
cannot use any strings to solve this.

Your program must implement a function
   def five_digits():
       ...
       
that finds and returns (and doesn't print!) the number.
