# Add your solution to the problem "horoscope" here.

#  Implement a comparison function for dates
#
#  Returns true if the date (month1, day1) is
#  earlier in the calendar than (month2, day2).
#  Assumes the days are valid and doens't do any checking.
def before(month1, day1, month2, day2)
    *** add your code here ***

    
# Implement a sign function.
#
# Returns the sign for the given month and day, or
# "INVALID_DATE" if the date is not valid, e.g. month=10 day=54
# Must not print anything out.
def sign(month, day):
    *** add your code here ***


# Your main function should prompt the user for a month and day and
# print out the sign using return value of the sign function.
def main():
    *** add your code here ***


# Runs the main function. Leave as is.
