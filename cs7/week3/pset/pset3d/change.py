# Add your solution to the problem "change" here.

# Implement a function print_change that takes in the results of your computation
# and prints them out in a message for the user. For example:
#
# Largest change of 25 from  84  to  59 
# occurred between day #6 and day #7.
#
# Must not prompt the user for anything.
def print_change(day1_price, day2_price, day1_num):
    *** add your code here ***

# Implement a function find_change that prompts the user for the
# appropriate number of stock prices and returns a list with the the
# value on the first day, the value on the second day, and the number
# of the first day, in that order.
#
# Takes no parameters.
# Must return a list.
def find_change():
    *** add your code here ***
    *** returns a list ***

# Implement a main function that computes the largest change as specified in problem 12,
# by using find_change to find the largest change and print_change to print the final answer.
def main():
    *** add your code here ***


# Runs the main function. Leave as is.
