"""
Write a function named print_longer that takes two lists as input and
prints out the longer one as well as the last element of the list. You
may assume the input lists are nonempty and your function should work
with any nonempty list no matter what the size. If the two lists are the
same length, it should print "The lists are the same length!" To give
you practice with f-strings, when printing the longer list you may only
use one print statement and it may only take one f-string as an
argument. Demonstrate your function works by testing it in a main
function. For example, print_longer(['chocolate', 'vanilla'],
[1, 5, 9, 7]) should print

[1, 5, 9, 7] is the longer list and its last element is 7
