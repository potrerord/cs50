Spotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played
songs from the past year.  In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio
Aura” for each user, a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods as
dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.”  Suppose Spotify
determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and
danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year.  In
answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:

1) If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how
would you characterize their audio aura?

    I might start by using the following query:

        SELECT AVG(energy),
               AVG(valence),
               AVG(danceability)
          FROM songs;

    to find the values in question.

    With some quick Google research, it looks like Spotify uses the
    following definitions for the three terms:

    Danceability: Numerical, danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.






2) Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not
be very representative of the listener.  What better ways of calculating
this aura would you propose?
