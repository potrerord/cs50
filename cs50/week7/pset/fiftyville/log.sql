/*
Note to self:

Authorities believe that the thief stole the duck and then, shortly
afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice.
Your goal is to identify:

Who the thief is,
What city the thief escaped to, and
Who the thiefâ€™s accomplice is who helped them escape


All you know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2021 and that it
took place on Humphrey Street.

10 Tables:

1)  crime_scene_reports
    -   descriptions will be worth looking at
    -   not sure what the id primary key means in this context -
            crime id?

2)  interviews
    -   this has transcripts in it, probably should look at all of
        those

3)  atm_transactions
    -   will likely be relevant for the escape? paying for flight?

4)  bank_accounts
    -   if they're dumb enough to use their bank account for this then
        maybe it's related to escape/flight

5)  airports
    -   maybe will use this to figure out where they landed? idk if this
        will be useful if i have flight info

6)  FLIGHTS
    -   WILL CONTAIN ITEM #2: CITY

7)  passengers
    -   probably will use this to verify suspect is on plane to
        destination city
    -   not sure if this is like just a list of sold tickets or like a
        confirmed list of passengers in attendance on the plane

8)  phone_calls
    -   no transcripts or anything here

9)  PEOPLE
    -   WILL CONTAIN ITEM #1: NAME OF THIEF
    -   WILL CONTAIN ITEM #3: NAME OF ACCOMPLICE
    -   this has the primary key id thing too so maybe it connects to
        the other tables? seems crazy to associate a crime id with a
        person

10) bakery_security_logs
    -
