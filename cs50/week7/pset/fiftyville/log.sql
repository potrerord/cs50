Note to self:

Authorities believe that the thief stole the duck and then, shortly
afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice.
Your goal is to identify:

Who the thief is,
What city the thief escaped to, and
Who the thiefâ€™s accomplice is who helped them escape


All you know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2021 and that it
took place on Humphrey Street.
