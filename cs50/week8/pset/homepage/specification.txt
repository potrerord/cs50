10+ HTML tags:

    1) <meta> - used for mobile responsiveness
    2) <ul> - unordered list for nav bars
    3) <li> - list items for nav bars
    4) <a> - anchor tag for links to other pages
    5) <h1> - formatted title
    6) <div> - containers for grouping sections
    7) <input> - email input for contact form
    8) <label> - label for contact form
    9) <button> - button for contact form
   10) <textarea> - text for contact form

5+ CSS properties:

    1) background-color: a common one in my site - I opted for dark mode!
    2) color: used this a lot as well to adjust text color for the dark theme
    3) margin: this was very helpful to center and space certain elements
    4) width: was useful to keep elements from taking up the entire page
    5) text-align: helped with centering text (obviously) and other elements

Usage of Javascript and Bootstrap:

    I used the Bootstrap styling sheets and some of their components to
    add some cool little features to my site like the cards on the main
    page or the contact form, and Javascript to make the site more
    interactive like in Trivia, displaying "Thank you!" on the contact
    form for example when the Submit button is clicked.
